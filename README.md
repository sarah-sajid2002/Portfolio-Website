📝: The original code reflects a complete MERN setup. However, I encountered challenges while hosting the full stack website. After spending several days troubleshooting, I decided to transfer the backend to Firebase for deployment. This allowed me to ensure a smooth user experience, even though the hosted version is not fully running on the MERN stack. The code in this repository still demonstrates the MERN architecture and can be referenced for learning or further development.
